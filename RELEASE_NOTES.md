# s3g-clap-max release notes

## v0.3.0 — 2026-08-07

This release adds automatic CLAP discovery while retaining all v0.2.1 host
features and shutdown protections.

### Added

- Load plugins by bundle filename, display name, or bundle identifier.
- Use a plugin name directly in the Max object:

  ```max
  [s3g.clap~ 0 64 "s3g Ambi Encoder Stochastic"]
  ```

- Use a name with the `open` message:

  ```max
  open "Encoder Stochastic"
  ```

- Search `CLAP_PATH` entries before the platform-standard CLAP locations.
- Recursively discover `.clap` bundles without loading their executables.
- Ignore case, spaces, underscores, hyphens, and punctuation during matching.
- Accept unique partial names and report candidate paths for ambiguous names.
- Report active discovery roots with the `getpaths` message.

### Verification

- Exact bundle-name, human-readable-name, bundle-identifier, `CLAP_PATH`, and
  ambiguity behavior are covered by the host smoke test.
- Encoder Stochastic is exercised with its native editor, 0-input/64-output
  topology, final-instance close, module reuse, and autorelease-pool shutdown.

## v0.2.1 — 2026-08-06

Initial distribution of `s3g.clap~`, a native Max/MSP external for hosting
CLAP audio plugins.

### Features

- Load macOS `.clap` bundles through a native selection dialog or direct path.
- Process audio with fixed input and output channel counts selected when the
  Max object is created.
- Enumerate, inspect, and control CLAP parameters.
- Send and receive MIDI events.
- Read and write plugin state through the CLAP state extension.
- Host embedded and floating native Cocoa plugin editors.
- Use a control interface modeled after the useful parts of Max's `vst~`
  object.

### Shutdown fix

v0.2.1 keeps initialized CLAP modules mapped for Max's process lifetime. This
prevents crashes when Max closes while a plugin's Cocoa editor still has
pending Objective-C objects. The fix was verified with the 64-output
**s3g Ambi Encoder Stochastic** plugin and its native editor open.

## Installation

1. Unzip `s3g-clap-max-0.3.0-macos-universal.zip`.
2. Place the resulting `s3g-clap-max` folder in
   `~/Documents/Max 9/Packages/`.
3. Restart Max.
4. Open `s3g.clap~.maxhelp`.

The included external is an ad-hoc-signed universal macOS binary supporting
Apple Silicon and Intel.
